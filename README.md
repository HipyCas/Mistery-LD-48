# Pinned: an old-style crime investigation game

Get into the body of a police officer to try solve a what on the first place seemed like a simple case, but that, as time passes and the investigation goes on, turns out to be much deeper than what it seemed liked at first. Developed by @HipyCas and @PabloGoesOnline.

## Download

There are zips available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. To download them, head to the [releases](https://github.com/HipyCas/Mystery-LD-48/releases) page of this repository, to the [Itch.io page](https://hipycas.itch.io/pinned) of the game or to the [Ludum Dare 48 Edition](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/pinned) page (fixed version to v1.0.0-alpha 2021-04-27).

To install them on your system you will have to follow different steps based on the OS. For windows, you should extract the application in a folder like `Program Files` and add the application executable (`Pinned.exe`) to the Start Menu folder. On linux, you probably want to put the executable (`mystery.x86_64`, better get it a easier name) under your path and create a desktop icon for it.

Platform specific builds (`.deb`, `.rpm`) and installers (Windows) are coming soon.

## How to play

The basic mechanics of the game consist on connecting hints (pins) together to create connections and solve puzzles.

- Center click/delete key to erase lines

- Escape key to quit at any time
